About: This website was made as a simple project to get myself aquainted with the workings of HTML and CSS and also have a single centralized site where all of the tools that one might need for measuring their fitness progress can be easily found. All of the tools found on this website are ones that I utilize on a regular basis to track out workout progress. The tools are presented in an easy understand manner so that a beginner can understand both what the tool is for and how to use it.
