        This website was made as a simple project to get us aquainted with the workings of
        HTML and CSS and also have a single centralized site where all of the tools that
        one might need for measuring their fitness progress can be easily found.
        All of the tools found on this website are ones that we utilize on a regular basis 
        to track out workout progress. The tools are presented in an easy understand manner
        so that a beginner can understand both what the tool is for and how to use it.
