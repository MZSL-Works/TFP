            This website was made as a simple project to get myself aquainted with the workings of
            HTML and CSS and also have a single centralized site where all of the tools that
            one might need for measuring their fitness progress can be easily found.
            All of the tools found on this website are ones that we utilize on a regular basis 
            to track out workout progress. The tools are presented in an easy understand manner
            so that a beginner can understand both what the tool is for and how to use it.

            Gonna have 4 main calculators for bmi, body fat % calc, one rep max, 
            calorie maintainence calculator. Gonna work on the backend so that that all works.
            And then the challange is to workout a login section so that you can record those
            stats and keep them and note the change over time.
